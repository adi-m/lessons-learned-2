Specifying software takeaways:
Survery end users to identify what they're looking for
Use the jobs-to-be-done framework to identify the problem that you're trying to solve
Describe what you want to the developer. However, it will likely not be what you need 
Use prototyping to develop a Minimum Viable Product
Don't build software till you need to!
