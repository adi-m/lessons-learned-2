The following is a number of key points when considering the benefits of having either an App or a Website:

- Websites also tend to be quicker to develop and bring to market.
- Apps tend to have hidden costs whereas website development is usually simpler
- Apps tend to have nore functionality compared to websites
- Apps can make use of push notifications on mobile devices and have offline capabilities unlike websites in general
